Hamilton Township was looking for an accessible playground for a community park that would work 
within a limited budget. Wendy Hudgins and New World Park Solution Team provided a playground that 
met all the needs of our community and were more than flexible when we requested additional 
components for the playground. The new playground was supplied and installed in a timely manner 
with no impact to existing park usage. I would wholeheartedly recommend New World Park Solutions 
for your next playground.

Once again I just wanted to thank you for sourcing this playground for our picnic grounds. 
We were impressed with the support you provided from our initial discussions all the way to the 
completion of this project. Each phone call was either answered immediately or shortly after, 
something most companies are lacking today.
